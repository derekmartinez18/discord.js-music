# Discord.js Music Plugin

This version is not yet stable, although has been mildly tested, it has not been that extensive. It's an update of the original by ruiqimao for Discord.js's version v11.x, and adds a few extra sprinkles. It still requires tweaks and testing but yeah it's something.

It adds:
* volume control (1 - 200)
* a music manager by Discord role (multi-server compatible, customizable)
* (optionally) restricts `skip` to the person who added the request, and music managers
* restricts `resume`, `pause`, and `volume` to music managers

Things to do:
* ~~Turn `musicManager` into an object to contain and support multiple guilds.~~
* Make sure it really really works
* Get search working again

Things left to test:
* Sharing queue across multiple servers 

Installation:  
1. Download and extract anywhere  
2. Edit examples/musicBot to match your needed config  
3. In the root folder, run:
```bash
npm install
```


This is a music plugin for Discord.js. Using it is as easy as:
```javascript
const Client = require('discord.js').Client;
const music = require('./path/to/this/project');

const client = new Client();
music(client);

client.login('< bot token here >');
```

The module consists of a single function, which takes two arguments:
```javascript
/*
 * Initialize the music plugin.
 *
 * @param client The Discord.js client.
 * @param options (Optional) A set of options to use:
 *                prefix: The prefix to use for the command (default '!').
 *                global: Whether to use the same queue for all servers
 *                        instead of server-specific queues (default false).
 *                maxQueueSize: The maximum queue size (default 20).
 				  volume: The volume to start playback at (default 50 [0.5]).
 				  		  anyoneCanSkip: Allow anyone to skip a track (if disabled, only the music managers + the person who added can skip). (default false).
 				  musicManager: The name of the Discord role approved to manage the bot. (default empty object)
 				  clearInvoker: Have the bot remove messages which invoke, these are the one that start with the 		 prefix provided. (default false)

 */
music(client, options);
```

How to add "Music Managers"
```javascript
musicManager: {
		'<server id>': '<role name>'
	},
```

**How to get server id?**  
1. Goto server settings  
2. Select 'Widget'  
3. Copy the number in `SERVER ID`

**What permissions do the roles need?**
- Nothing, this uses only the _name_ of the role rather than permissions.

The commands available are:
* `play <url>`: Play a video/music. It can take a URL from various services (YouTube, Vimeo, YouKu, etc). Search has been removed temporally until a workaround can be found.
* `skip [number]`: Skip some number of songs. Will skip 1 song if a number is not specified.
* `queue`: Display the current queue.
* `pause`: Pause music playback. (requires music manager)
* `resume`: Resume music playback. (requires music manager)
* `volume`: Adjust the playback volume between 1 and 200 (requires music manager)
